== Installation ==

1. Upload the Easy Pricing Tables plugin file (`easy-pricing-tables.zip`) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In your sidebar, select 'Pricing Tables -> Add New' to create a new table

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm using S2 member / WooCommerce / etc and would like to replace your built-in Easy Pricing Tables button with a button generated from a shortcode =
To disable the pricing table button and replace it with a shortcode, simply enter the following in the 'Button Text' row:
`[shortcode][my-example-shortcode/][/shortcode]`

= My pricing table rows aren't aligned properly =
If within the same row, you use a lot more text in some features than in others, your feature height alignment might be weird.
This problem is due to tables being responsive instead of fixed width. You can fix it by adding manual linebreaks for your features.
<br/><br/> results in one linebreak.

= I want to change the design for each individual column =
This currently isn't supported in the user interface. However, each column has its own unique HTML class that can be modified using a css class selector.

*	Class of the first column: ptp-col-id-0
*	Class of the second column: ptp-col-id-1
*	Class of the third column: ptp-col-id-2
*	etc...

= How do I change the design of individual pricing table feature rows? =
This currently isn't supported in the user interface. However, each feature row has its own unique HTML class that can be modified using a css class selector.

*	Class of the first feature row: ptp-row-id-0
*	Class of the second feature row: ptp-row-id-1
*	Class of the third feature row: ptp-row-id-2
*	etc...

= I want to adjust my pricing table column width =
This currently isn't supported in the user interface. This plugin uses a fixed percentage column width based on how many columns your pricing table has.
For example, if your pricing table has 3 columns, each column has the following HTML class: ``ptp-three-col``.

The default CSS in this case looks like this:
`
.ptp-three-col {
	width: 31%;
}
`

Example code for changing your column width you can add to your theme:
`
.ptp-three-col {
width: 25%!important;
}
`

= Does this plugin use JavaScript? =
We're using a small jQuery library called (jquery.matchHeight.js)[https://github.com/liabru/jquery-match-height] for the "Automatically match Row Height" feature. This small library won't significantly impact load time.
